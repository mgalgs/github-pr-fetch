# Github PR Fetch

This is a simple Firefox extension that adds a `git fetch` command to
GitHub pull request pages, making it easy to fetch and check out pull
requests locally.

Just copy the `git fetch` command and then do whatever you want with
`FETCH_HEAD` (e.g. `git checkout FETCH_HEAD`, `git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD`,
`git merge FETCH_HEAD`, etc.).
