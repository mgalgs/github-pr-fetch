# Github PR Fetch

This is a simple Firefox extension that adds a `git fetch` command to
GitHub pull request pages, making it easy to fetch and check out pull
requests locally.

# Installation

TODO: Firefox add-ons store...

You can install this temporarily in your current Firefox session as
follows:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/mgalgs/github-pr-fetch.git`

2. Open Firefox, and enter `about:debugging` in the URL bar.

3. Click "This Firefox" (in newer versions of Firefox) or "Load Temporary Add-on" (in older versions).

4. Open the `github-pr-fetch/extension` directory and select any file inside the directory.

The extension should now be temporarily installed, and you'll see it listed in your add-ons.
